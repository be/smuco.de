title: Git autocorrect is awesome
---

h2. {{ page.title }}

Being a somewhat sloppy typer from time to time, I have countless times mistyped the common git commands. Does this look familiar?

{% highlight bash %}
>> git puhs
git: 'puhs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
  push
{% endhighlight %}

I noticed that git actually guesses the command I really wanted to type. I would be so awesome if there was some sort of "I'm feeling lucky" feature in git. 

And there is!

{% highlight bash %}
git config --global help.autocorrect 5
{% endhighlight %}

This will make git execute the command it thinks you are trying to type. The last parameter will make git wait half a second before executing the command, so tweak that to something you are comfortable with.

{% highlight bash %}
>> git puhs
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'puhs', which does not exist.
Continuing under the assumption that you meant 'push'
in 0.5 seconds automatically...
Everything up-to-date
{% endhighlight %}

Awesome :)
